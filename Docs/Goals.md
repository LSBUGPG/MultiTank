## How to make a multi-player game in Unity

My aim is to learn how to build a multi-player game in Unity with lobby and game sections.

## Self-assessment

I've never built a multi-player game in Unity before, although I have built multi-player games in other engines.

## Resources

I will make use of the included Unity documentation, the Unity forums, and YouTube tutorials.
